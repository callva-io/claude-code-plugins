# Resilience and Retry Patterns

Automations that call external APIs will eventually hit transient failures: network blips, rate limits, 502 Bad Gateways, connection resets, flaky DNS. A script that crashes on the first flake is fragile and hard to operate. This document describes the retry and error-handling patterns that make pipelines robust without swallowing real bugs.

## The `withRetry` helper

Wrap every external call in a retry helper that retries on failure with linear backoff and returns a tagged `Result`:

```typescript
type Result<T> = { ok: true; data: T } | { ok: false; error: string };

async function withRetry<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  retries: number,
  label: string,
): Promise<Result<T>> {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const data = await fn();
      return { ok: true, data };
    } catch (e: any) {
      const msg = e?.message ?? String(e);
      if (attempt < retries) {
        const delay = 1000 * (attempt + 1); // 1s, 2s, 3s...
        log(`[RETRY] ${label} — attempt ${attempt + 1} failed: ${msg}, retrying in ${delay}ms`);
        await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, delay));
      } else {
        return { ok: false, error: msg };
      }
    }
  }
  return { ok: false, error: "unreachable" };
}
```

Usage:

```typescript
const tokenResult = await withRetry(
  () => getAuthToken(baseUrl, username, apiKey),
  2,
  "External API login",
);
if (!tokenResult.ok) {
  log(`[FATAL] ${tokenResult.error}`);
  return { status: "failed", phase: "auth", error: tokenResult.error };
}
const token = tokenResult.data;
```

## Why `Result<T>` instead of throwing?

A discriminated union makes the failure branch **visible to the caller and mandatory to handle**. You cannot accidentally forget to catch. The type checker will complain if you try to read `.data` without first checking `.ok`.

Exceptions remain appropriate for unrecoverable programmer errors (invariant violations, schema mismatches, unreachable code). But for expected runtime failures (API flakes, auth expiry, rate limits), `Result<T>` is clearer and safer.

The pattern also composes well with accumulated errors (below) — you can push a failed `Result` into an errors array and continue processing, instead of short-circuiting the whole run.

## Recoverable vs fatal errors

Not every failure should kill the run. Distinguish the two cases explicitly:

### Fatal — return early with `status: "failed"`

Anything that makes the remainder of the pipeline impossible:

- Auth failure (can't get an API token → can't do anything)
- Missing required variable (no `CALLVA_API_KEY` → every subsequent call fails)
- Config error (unknown workspace, missing project)

```typescript
if (!tokenResult.ok) {
  return {
    status: "failed",
    phase: "auth",
    error: tokenResult.error,
    errors: [{ phase: "auth", context: "medicloud login", error: tokenResult.error }],
  };
}
```

### Recoverable — log, accumulate, continue

Anything that affects one item in a batch but doesn't prevent other items from being processed:

- Failure to fetch one doctor's appointments (other doctors still work)
- Failure to create one call record (other records still succeed)
- Failure to combine one multi-visit group (other groups still combine)

```typescript
const errors: RunError[] = [];

// ... inside a batch loop ...
const res = await withRetry(() => createCall(appt), 1, `Create ${appt.id}`);
if (!res.ok) {
  errors.push({
    phase: "create",
    context: `${appt.full_name} (${appt.phone})`,
    error: res.error,
  });
  log(`[ERROR] Failed to create ${appt.full_name}: ${res.error}`);
  continue;
}
```

At the end of the run, the errors array is included in the return value:

```typescript
return {
  status: errors.length > 0 ? "completed_with_errors" : "success",
  // ... counts ...
  errors, // full list for drill-down in the Windmill UI
};
```

## The `RunError` shape

Every accumulated error should be structured, not a bare string:

```typescript
interface RunError {
  phase: string;    // "auth", "fetch", "create", "combine" — matches log tags
  context: string;  // which item, which record, which identifier
  error: string;    // the raw error message
}
```

When a run lands in the Windmill UI with 5 errors, you want to see them as an inspectable list with enough context to reproduce, not a concatenated mush.

## Status taxonomy

Use three run-level status values in return objects:

- `"success"` — everything worked, `errors.length === 0`
- `"completed_with_errors"` — some items failed but the run reached the end
- `"failed"` — fatal error, the run could not complete

This lets alerting and monitoring distinguish "one flaky item" from "entire pipeline down" without parsing the errors array.

## Retry budget

- **External API calls**: 2 retries (3 attempts total) with 1s/2s linear backoff. Enough to paper over transient network issues without wasting the 60s Windmill execution budget.
- **Create operations**: 1 retry. Creates are cheap to retry and often succeed on the second try after a brief rate limit.
- **Auth operations**: 2 retries. If auth still fails after 3 attempts, something is actually broken — faster failure is better than prolonged retry.
- **Sub-job dispatch**: 0 retries. Windmill's own queue handles durability.

Do not retry indefinitely. The 60-second execution limit will bite you. If an operation has intrinsically slow recovery (e.g. a cold-start service that takes 30s to come back), design around it — increase the first retry's initial wait, or accept partial failure and let a later run catch up.

## Timeouts on external calls

Use `AbortSignal.timeout()` to bound individual fetches. A `fetch()` that hangs will consume the entire 60-second budget silently:

```typescript
const res = await fetch(url, {
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000), // 10 seconds
});
```

Rule of thumb: 10s for external APIs you trust, 15s for ones known to be slow, 5s for internal health checks.

## When this doesn't apply

Pure transforms with no external API calls don't need `withRetry`. A script that reads variables, does math, and returns a value has nothing to retry. Don't add ceremony for problems the script doesn't have.
